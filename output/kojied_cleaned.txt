Title: I feel violated by intern season
Text: There's this bar that I frequent a few blocks away from my house. Technically different neighborhood, but generally has a mature vibe with people who like music and to dance. Today when I went to the bar and all of a sudden I felt like I was at a college basement party. I thought that I must have been hallucinating, but Then a girl pointed at me and referred to me as the old person. That's when I knew I had to get out of there. I was at the wrong party. As I walk back home, all of a sudden I realize that there were now tens of thousands of 18 year-old 19 year-old 20-year-olds who were all living on top of each other and were super young and horny to basically use the New York nightlife as their own personal orgy dome. Naturally I felt violated But then again, I thought to myself. Am I not the same as they are, just at a longer time horizon? I'm also a transient being in the city. They might only be here for three months, but I've only been here for three years as well. As a matter fact, there are bunch of people have done this for generations where their parents and their grandparents and their grandparents all met in New York, and they all decided to live somewhere in the broader region whether it be Westchester, Wilmington, Big Indian, Boston, etc. New York City is equally adventurous to each, so who am I to judge how others enjoy this adventurous city.

Title: Would you guys like to see Pokemon Go in AVP?
Text: Hi guys, I think Pokemon could be one of the killer use case for the vision pro. Imagine, you could fight players from around the world from the comfort of your couch. With the recent controversy around Palworld, they're looking for the next "Pokemon Go" that would propel their franchise to the next level. Being Japanese, I happen to know a few key decision makers both in the Pokemon Company as well as Niantic. Alot of the in-game designs are transferrable, and I believe it's a matter of time until Niantic's Lightship ARDK will work on AVP. What should I tell them? Lmk if you have thoughts or useful links/videos I should forward to them. I'm confident that this will eventually become a thing, but the faster they ship the more AVP adoption we'll see.

Title: Can you actually “work” in AVP?
Text: I’m curious if people have been able to fully port their workflow into AVP. I’ve been trying to actually use the Vision Pro to get some work done, but without github and visual studio code, it’s not been the easiest (also obviously no terminal). I could use Mac virtual display, but since I have a M1 MBP the latency is noticeable to the point it’s an adverse experience. I already dropped $4k on this device, renewing my MBP just so I can use it with my AVP is asking a bit too much… Also where’s Xcode? If Apple wants AVP to be a “work device”, they gotta have at least Xcode right? I can get the simple stuff like emails done through AVP, but if this device can’t replace my entire workflow, I don’t know if I can justify the price. I’m sure it’ll get resolved down the line (more of a software issue than hardware constraints), but curious to hear how realistic it is for people to port over their workflow to AVP, and what apps you’d like to see ASAP.

Title: 【Theory】 What if we live in the void 800 century
Text: Let’s say the WG is the current western civilization. The birth of Western history is in the Middle East, specifically Iraq (Nippur). Which is why the west, led by the US, has been trying to cause instability, and destroy historical artifacts. That way, the true history of how the WG came to be won’t come into light. Like, archaeology is basically using artifacts discovered and interpreting it a certain way. The whole concept is something that mostly grew into a concept in the UK around 1824. 1824 is the year the Oxford English Dictionary defined "archaeology" a word. (Btw our generation will be remembered for our new additions which include anti-work, curry laksa, diet-busting, final frontier, fugazi, gajillion, skellington, straight-talking, stonkingly, voguing,etc.) Back to the main topic, what I’m saying is that it’s pretty easy for the “1%” to control the “story of our world” through archeologists and historians. These have traditionally been an activity for the rich and remains that way. Like, who tries to become a historian unless they have trust funds? So yeah, maybe the history we are told on a daily basis is pretty different from reality, and Oda is trying to tell us this message. What are pacifistas? They're our modern comparable to AI. They will be the ultimate, infinite, obedient, power between the celestial dragons (also known as the 1%) and us normal humans. So who is our Nika? Who is our Joy Boy? are we too early to hear the drums of liberation, or do we actually all have our own drums of liberation? &#x200B; &#x200B; [tourism of 19th century](

Title: Tracking our individual impacts on the world through ESG ratings
Text: &#x200B; [Mock-up of ESG scores ]( &#x200B; We've had ESG ratings for decades now, but it hasn't played a significant role in the eyes of the consumer. Sure it has developed new investing policies and has made some impact from the shareholder side, but as someone who's worked in environmental consulting, I felt that we needed a more direct way of getting ESG ratings into the mass conscience. Do you think individuals should be aware of our own ESG rating? I feel that companies would take ESG ratings seriously if consumers changed their purchase behaviors based on the score. The current method of consumer activism has yielded lackluster results. This is because once the news dies down, consumers forget about the scandal and go back to normal purchasing behavior. In addition, companies aren't really incentivized to make changes, since consumers hear about the scandal, but rarely stay informed about what was done about it. The first step towards voting with our dollars is to be aware of our current ESG impact. This can be approximated through the ESG score of the companies you are purchasing goods/services from, multiplied by the dollar amount of your purchase. [Sustainalytics]( has a comprehensive ESG rating for most public companies. For purchases from businesses that are private (and doesn't have any ESG rating), we can approximate from comparable public companies, or use other indicators (BCorp, Fair Trade, etc.) Please let me know what you think! Individual ESG scores could elevate sustainable conscience to another level, which would lead to climate activism on a larger scale.

Title: How do you decide what to buy and not buy?
Text: I've been lurking in this channel for a while now, and have been greatly inspired by the ways people have found ways to stretch their money. This got me thinking, is there a way to develop a mental model on what we buy or don't buy? I feel that most people decide what to buy based on past experiences, gut feeling, or the mood of that day. But is there a way to better understand what we get our "gratification" from, and track this? My initial idea was an app that would enable users to track the "gratification" they receive from their purchases. If you regret what you bought, you can record a decline in the gratification, or if you found the purchase better than you expected, you can record an increase. Of course, this would not necessarily apply to all purchases. Some things (rent, insurance, etc.) do not yield any gratification scores, but many purchases (clothes, going out, etc.) could. &#x200B; Would love to hear how you make your purchase decisions, and if there's a mental model you follow! (photo is a mockup of the idea I'm working on)

Text: That proximity is ridiculous, deep mining, two fishing huts, vegetable, orchards, and trade iron for malt. imo trading raw materials is easier than trading crafted goods in the current build. High quantity stuff is easy to stock, and you could have multiple trading posts up without any major issues. The exact opposite of this is plate armor. It takes forever to build, requires three points, and needs eight iron slabs to make it. It’s cheaper to just export the ore, and since it’s a low quantity trade, it’s hard to stick multiple trade posts with it

Text: \- the hype has definitely faded, you can see that with the price as well as the number of people discussing it on X, or even here \- haven't seen much innovation in the space at all, the momentum seems to have shifted to solana memecoins, and dissipated after that \- again, people no longer seem interested. I found linksDAO to be an interesting concept of fractionally owning a golf course, and they're still active but not much hype around them anymore either. Most major brand NFT collaborations have died down as well \- the NFT craze has not settled into something sustainable, it's dead. Can it come back? Possibly, it has happened before, when cryptopunks and cryptokitties were first hot in 2017-ish, then died, then came back during 2020-2022. \- will there be a big boom? I personally don't think it would in the way we think of NFTs as collectables. A major thesis was around digital scarcity, and that seemed possible during covid, but post covid people went back to f2f interactions. Digital scarcity could become a hot topic again if we see a broader adoption of VR or even XR, but that seems a bit down the line. I think fractional ownership of assets could be interesting, but they'd just be fungible tokens, not NFT I see so many one-off posts on this community with only a couple responses. Can't believe there's 2.7M members here. That alone should tell you that NFTs are no longer something people are interested in. I'd love to be proven wrong, since I feel that there was alot of potential, but so far it seems like the community is dead

Oh and the proliferation of gambling definitely doesn’t help either. As a matter of fact, there’s way too many ad breaks.

Text: Go to the fire station and stock up on axes. Then go to the hardware store and get a sledgehammer. Destroy the staircase to the second floor of the fire station so zombies can’t get to it. Stop by the bookstore and VHS store to get The generator magazine and skill tapes, then head to the gun store. If you have the burgler trait Hotwire vehicles, and then secure some food and water.

Text: The optimal strategy I've discovered is the following 1. rush artist/writer slots and fill them 2. rush renaissance era via acoustics 3. bulb writer to fill rationalism slots 4. if AI wants to be friends, accept (unless negative impact with neighboring civs) and do research agreement 5. internal food routes (usually to city with artist slots) 6. pay neighbors to fight eachother (so you don't get attacked) 7. rush and work science buildings 8. 7 turns (10 if standard speed) after building and rushing research lab (and working the slot), bulb science, beeline for stealth bombers. (if you have a religion use faith to buy 3-4 scientists) 9. if you have the capacity, build out military buildings (up to military academy) so you have air repair 10. go dominate or yeet off to space I'm usually ahead of AI by the time I build research labs (although they may have more total techs since they fill the science tree more balanced), and left them in the dust when I bulb It does get a bit boring after a while though, so I'm trying to find ways to diversify the gameplay.

If you still want to take the bus, download the Coach USA, and buy the tickets in advance. Or pay by cash at the bus stop. It's a bit hard to find though, so might want to ask around as well.

Text: Dating apps have been normalized but I still would prefer irl encounters compared to apps. Apps also make you see dates as trivial, since there’s always another girl one tap away. I usually take the time to leave quality comments, and around 1/3 of them materialize into matches. Some will just like without responding, but I feel like more often than not they do respond. It might also be the type of people I’m attracted to though. I’ve noticed those in their early 20s aren’t really good at conversations, or get more matches so they don’t care as much. Is there a certain demographic you tend to match with? (Race, age, career)

Text: First of all you look good! But if you want to become more "conventionally attractive", here are some of my suggestions. Just personal opinions, take them or leave them. Do away with glasses - Have you considered contacts? If not you should look into it. Or lasik although that's a bit pricy (and scary to some). I did it and was the best decision ever. Work out - make sure to get enough protein and look into creatine as well I'd recommend losing weight though cardio & eating healthier, as well as build muscle though bench and squats. Don't forget to stretch too since you can injure yourself! And get a gym rat to spot you. Once you start losing weight you'll see your face slim down as well [ [ Fashion - Uniqlo is a good start, but you gotta dress well in Uniqlo [ (If you're in Japan just buy them there it's cheaper haha) I wouldn't recommend you wearing anime related items if you're trying to be "conventionally attractive". Make it something very subtle, like a tiny totoro tattoo on your wrist, or a ring which doesn't shout ANIMEEEEE! Also if someone asks your about it you can elaborate on your interest, but keep it short and succinct so you don't nerd out until you know they are interested in learning more. If you can afford it, go one layer above and try Cos [ Eyebrows - Go get your brows done at an Indian threading place. Take a picture of it, and try to recreate it via shaver below [ Skincare - You seem to be on the oily side like me. Wash your face daily, and use a decent face cream and serum. Here's the ones I use. [ [ [ Hair \- Honestly I don't know. You could grow it out, shave it, or keep as is. If you're going to shave it keep the beard because you gotta keep one of them. If you're worried about balding there's these crazy services in Turkey where they will regrow your hair (example below). My colleague did it and he looked messed up for a month but now looks amazing (not at this particular spot). [ Last but not least, get yourself out there! Getting experience with women/men whoever you are attracted to, is the best way to build confidence. Make mistakes, learn, and grow as a person. Wishing the best for you!

Text: There are some key technologies which can give you significant advantage in the early game, either in military or in science. The ones for military are composite Bowmans, chariots, crossbow etc, but the great library doesn’t really help you obtain these since they’re on the opposite side of the tech tree. As in, if you want to beeline for those it’s faster to research those tech instead of researching and beelining for great library. I think the great library can be beneficial in getting to theology faster, which will get you to borobudur. That’s game changing if you are pushing for religion (which honestly you should unless there are reasons not to). The great scientist points are great to have early on, although you often use them for bulk popping once you have research labs up and running. I usually play at deity where the AI starts miles ahead in technology so don’t even bother, but if you’re playing king or emperor it should be a decent strat.

Text: It’s a combination of multiple factors, your military strength, the amount of GPT/luxury you can offer, their military might, the other civ’s might, etc. What seems to impact it the most is how bloodthirsty the AI is. Shaka will go to war with almost anyone, it’s impossible to get Ghandi to attack, unless he’s got nukes. I feel that it’s balanced considering that the violent civs tend to attack you, and those are the ones you can bribe relatively easily. Even if the civs aren’t neighbors, if you can get them to declare war on one another they will most likely not attack you, which is already a win. You have the largest disadvantage at the beginning of the game, so it’s easier to catch up as you invest the resources to non-military infrastructure, while your competitors burn hammers on swords and arrows.

Text: The founders may have had good intentions, but they definitely didn’t deliver on them. As for the brands that veve partnered with, they probably saw it more as a marketing opportunity, and considering how a few people care about NFTs, they see the impact of their apathy as negligible to the overall brand image. Disney for instance, have received way more flack about trying to use Disney+ terms and conditions on the victim who died in their theme park. The reality is that mainstream attention has moved away from NFTs (if there ever was any), and so they’ve written it off as one of the many, many things they’d like to sweep under the rug.

Text: I'm Japanese, and the translation isn't entirely accurate The first half is correct (Not a happy ending), but the second half is closer to "You're right.. there's alot of foreshadowing which was not resolved". The word 未回収 is often used for "flags", which mean specific plot points or foreshadowing made earlier in the story. It's not clear if he's talking about MiA, but if so, he's talking about MiA having a unhappy (or unsatisfying) ending, and that some foreshadowing were not addressed.

Text: Depends on your definition of "quick", but you can crack into Private Equity you'd likely have \5M in net worth by the time you're 40. Key to "rich" is to have assets which appreciate in value, but also have sufficient income to pay for your daily expenses. PE will give you both. There's a reason why it's such a highly coveted career in the white collar space. The most straight forward way to get there is to get into a target school, maintain high GPA, get into a good IB program, then recruit for PE. Is it competitive? Yes. Is it going to be long hours and hard work? Yes. But it'll set you and your future generation for financial independence. Being from a wealthy family who can donate their way into an ivy league school or have family friends who are GPs would make it much much much easier, but you can make it happen with hard work and dedication. (Of course, similar to the tech meltdown, it's unclear if this model will be viable a decade or two in the future. But if the rich are going to get richer, it will continue to happen through PE, and you'll get a piece of that pie being at the table)

That's based on the assumption flights won't get delayed. I feel like rarely any flights land on time these days, so I'd probably add another 2 hour buffer just to be safe. You also can't get any refund on the amtrak if your flight is delayed, because they're not operated by the same company too

Text: Truly incredible how Hollywood still struggles to tell a story just with minorities. It’ll change though, with increased representation in directing, script writing, acting, etc. Just to be clear I’m not against movies with white people in it. I just think there could be more movies which accurately represent the world we live in, without ostracizing the majority of the world’s population. Sad to see people in a community about a story which predominantly takes place in China downvoting comments expressing more representation.

Regarding the other female characters in the movie, they definitely could’ve done a better job in terms of character development or playing a role in the story. It felt like they added them in to not make it a sausage fest without considering if they brought anything pivotal to the storyline

Text: I don’t even think they appealed to the US audience. The US is almost 50/50 in terms of white/non-white, but the cast was way whiter than it needed to be. Especially considering that we already have enough stories told from a white perspective and this isn’t one of them

Text: Here are some of the top scientific figures involved in the Manhattan Project, including women: J. Robert Oppenheimer (Scientific Director) Enrico Fermi Leo Szilard Ernest Lawrence Hans Bethe Arthur Compton Glenn Seaborg Rudolf Peierls Otto Frisch Emilio Segrè Felix Bloch Eugene Wigner James Chadwick Niels Bohr Edward Teller Klaus Fuchs Harold Urey Luis Alvarez John von Neumann George Kistiakowsky Seth Neddermeyer Robert Serber Victor Weisskopf Rudolf Brill Leona Woods Marshall Libby (one of the few women physicists on the project) Maria Goeppert Mayer (theoretical physicist, later a Nobel laureate) Lilli Hornig (chemist who worked on plutonium purification) Stanisław Ulam Isidor Isaac Rabi Willis Lamb Emil Konopinski C. J. Mackenzie Philip Abelson Walter Zinn Samuel Goudsmit Herbert L. Anderson Bernard Waldman David Bohm George Placzek Chien-Shiung Wu (physicist who helped develop the process for separating uranium isotopes) Joan Hinton (physicist who worked on the uranium enrichment process) Joseph W. Kennedy Charles Allen Thomas Norman Hilberry Alvin Weinberg Louis Slotin Philip Morrison Robert R. Wilson George Weil While this list includes 49 scientists, it is by no means exhaustive. Several women, such as Leona Woods Marshall Libby, Maria Goeppert Mayer, Lilli Hornig, Chien-Shiung Wu, and Joan Hinton, made valuable contributions to the Manhattan Project, even though they were a small minority among the thousands of people involved.

Text: I’d hope they will take advantage of their sports partnerships to push immersive video content. I’m sure they’re willing to leverage this if they decide to go all in on the category. I presume they’ll ramp up production as they get closer to the second generation vision device, and based on the consumer reception they’ll fully commit.

Text: I’ll preface by saying that I’m Japanese (have grown up half in Japan and half outside of Japan), so my perspective isn’t that of Taiwanese people. My understanding is Taiwan was the first major region that Japan occupied, and thus Japan put in a significant effort to create a model colony out of Taiwan. They surveyed the island, took biological records of the wildlife, and to an extent modernized Taiwan. I was surprised to see how a sizable portion of Taiwan’s natural history museum were contributions by Japanese scientists when I went to Taipei. However, I think it’s about how people in Taiwan perceive Japanese occupation which is relevant. This actually isn’t entirely about what Japan did in Taiwan, but what came after. The kuomintang led nationalist government committed mass murder (known as the 228 incident), which made those who lived through both eras look back fondly at the era of Japanese occupation. I’m not trying to justify colonialism, but feel that the atrocities by the nationalism government seems to have painted a (relatively) positive light of the Japanese occupation in the eyes of the elders. I am curious to hear a Taiwanese persons’ perspective on this though, because my understanding is that the occupying japanese forces also did their fair share of inhumane acts during the occupation.

Text: I think there's a stark difference between fetishizing and respecting a certain culture. If you're putting up Japanese artwork as art and is respecting it, I doubt any Japanese person will take offense. But making some cheap piece of clothing and branding it as "kimono" since it will sell better is disrespectful in my eyes. I think the keyword here is "authenticity" and "respect". As long as one adopts a culture with these in mind, there is nothing wrong with it. But it's ultimately up to those who belong in the original culture to decide if these standards are being met. Obviously there is no "singular hive mind of Japanese consciousness", and the answer will depend from person to person. As Japan becomes more racially/culturally diverse (albeit slower than most other nations), these definitions will shift. A Ukrainian born woman (ethnically entirely white European) just became Ms. Japan, which led to alot of backlash. Personally I think this is a welcoming change as Japan embraces diversity, especially as she is much more culturally Japanese than most ethnically Japanese people. I feel Japan should redefine what it means to be Japanese, and cultural symbols like her or Osaka Naomi, Rui Hachimura, are pushing the envelope in a positive way. And to answer your question: Traditionally (pre industrial revolution) kimonos were worn by people of different social class for a variety of occasions. Kimono actually means "clothes", which includes sub categories such as samui (work clothes) or yukata (summer clothes). There's also a word for western clothes (洋服), which is what most people wear these days. In modern era, there are certain occasions you are more likely to see it (e.g. summer festivals, tea ceremony, black tie events), but it's not uncommon to see people wearing kimono on the streets any time of the year. Maybe it's worth having a conversation with your daughter-in-law to get her perspective on it.

Text: Not sure why you have so many downvotes, I think your comment is entirely valid. I’d say you have to experience it yourself to understand the difference. I’ve had the Quest 2 and Quest pro, and have built apps on the Meta store. So I’d say I’m more involved in the ecosystem than an average Apple consumer. I’d say the image quality, user experience, and seamlessness of the apple ecosytem can’t be understated (only applies if you are an iPhone/mac user). Being able to connect via your iPhone and not having to set up the Wi-Fi, or your AirPods automatically connecting to the device feels “magical”. I’m not convinced if I’ll keep the device though, it’s way too expensive and if this doesn’t entirely replace my Mac, or I want to build in the VR ecosystem again, I can’t justify the price. So far it‘s more of an iPad replacement in terms of productivity, and the verdict is yet to be out on if I want to build on this thing.

Text: I think the killer app will be interactive storytelling with realistic characters. With GPT and AVP we're halfway there. Lip syncing is almost a solved problem, gestures and facial expressions are still unresolved. Now is that the world we want to live in? Maybe it's not so different than people being glued onto their phones all the time. Personally, I go back and fourth on whether I want to live in a world where people spend multiple hours a day with a headset glued to their face.

Text: I’ve been there many times, to the point I became friends with the bartender. It’s usually a 1.5-3 hour wait for the back room, unless you go at weird hours. I’d recommend you skip the first room since they just serve overpriced cocktails on tap. The line outside is for both the first and second rooms. Get in line, and the staff will eventually get to you asking if you want to put your name down for the back room. Go ahead and do it, then leave the line. Go grab dinner somewhere nearby for an hour or two, I’d recommend Cocoron although they only take cash. You actually don’t have to wait in the line to get into the second room. When you get a notification, head over and tell the staff you got the text. Smooth sailing from there! French toast and key lime pie are my favorites

Text: I’m here at the club as I type this out, and I think it’s great for my particular situation. Price: it goes up precipitously after the first few years, so it depends on how many years it’s been since you’ve graduated Hotels: I don’t think it’s worth it, it’s pretty expensive from what I understand and the amenities are mid. Fitness facility: Has everything you’d want, including peloton machines. Equipment and gym isn’t necessarily the newest, but it’s clean and spacious. Also they have great sauna and steam rooms. Bars/restaurant Decent but nothing special. Price is high-ish, but happy hours and oyster nights are a pretty good deal. Their drinks are STRONG! Events: I think it’s okay, they have a bunch of events all the time, but it can get a bit repetitive. I guess it depends for what you’re looking for.

Text: Thanks alot! Hearing you say that you can't believe this doesn't exist yet is the best compliment I can receive. It definitely seems like this app would work in tandem with a budgeting app. ADHD is real, and it's only getting more real with people's attention span shortening (short form video content, etc.) &#x200B; How do you currently do the budgeting, list making, reviews? What kind of interface do you think you would find valuable? &#x200B; (back to the other points you mentioned) Another reason I wanted to build this app is because we're in a crazy economic period where most people in America are starting to feel the pressure. Groceries are expensive, rent is up, but our wages just haven't increased at the same pace. If you ask me, the way middle class Americans have lived their lives for the past century is an outlier in the history of humankind. For most of history, majority of the world lived "paycheck-to-paycheck", even if their "paychecks" came in the form of crop harvest. But it doesn't have to be, in this day and age! We can find ways to find fulfillment without having to get the newest gadgets, fashion items, or travel to Greece every summer.

Text: Yeah retail therapy is a coping mechanism which hits you with dopamine, but you oftentimes don't end up getting the utility from the purchase in the way you thought. One of the reasons I wanted to build this app is because I used to treat purchasing as retail therapy as well, and one day I bought one too many things I wasn't going to use, and was like 'hol up. How would you like to track the value you get from your purchases, and do you think this would help you make better purchase decisions in the future?

Text: Thanks! I'm looking into the 9 step program in the book and it's amazing. But yeah, the concept is the same. I'm assuming the default is that you initially felt that purchase added to your life (otherwise why did you even decide to buy it lol), so reflecting back, it would be whether the purchase added more than you expected, or less than you expected. I like the +- idea instead of doing it 5/5. It feels more intuitive. Yeah, I felt that there are times it gets revised more than once. For instance, you bought a PS5, loved it for the first few weeks, but stopped playing with it once the novelty wore off. In that case, the line chart would go up, then down. I feel that there is a threshold on the price point people care about (around $50?), and the frequency people want to track purchases (every two weeks?). We could set a default, and the user can change it the way they seem fit. We would also avoid large ticket expenses which would not make sense (groceries, rent, insurance, etc.) and focus on discretionary spending (dinners, movies, new kitchenware, etc.).

It's a common tactic used by startups to achieve growth, you see it with airbnb, ubers, etc. I'm on eBay or Mercari all the time too. It's a great place to find deals. Have you looked back to think about whether the purchase was "worth it"?

Text: Thanks! Recurring purchases definitely makes sense. There's a plethora of "give us your credit card info and we'll tell you all the hidden subscriptions you forgot about", but none of them (to my knowledge) enables you to compare the per-dollar-gratification you get from said subscription. My hypothesis was that you could forecast some of these things based on your past (similar) purchases, or how others (similar to you in demographics) rated the "gratification" they received from the product the day after, week after, and a month after. It takes the current reviewing system a step further, and tracks the gratification over time, as well as break it down to those who are similar to you.

Text: Yes! Comparing the per-dollar gratification of your consumption is what I think would be worth tracking. I like your coffee shop example. You see diminishing gratification in returning to the same coffee shop, so would prefer to spend the same $5 going to a new one. Better yet, save that money to go check out the new restaurant that opened down the street. The social aspect of this would be very interesting. Comparing what your significant other perceives to be the better use of money, or seeing what people of similar demographics perceive is "worth-it", could be great reference points for future purchases. In an ideal world, how would you like to track this "gratification" data?

For example, let's say you have a budget for home improvement. Do you replace your vacuum, or the AC? I think we all have our own formulas around purchases, but oftentimes do not reflect on the purchases we made. I was wondering if this was something people would be interested in tracking, in order to make better purchase decisions going forwards.

[COMMENT]
Text: Thanks for the input! The list is just an example, not of my actual purchases. I like how you divide physical and emotional need. If I was to challenge your example though, isn't that how one starts calling shopping "retail therapy"? Everyone values things differently, so it's impossible to come up with a universal metric. The only common rule of thumb is relativity amongst your other purchases. "How do I compare a bar of chocolate to a denim jacket? Would a hundred chocolate bars bring more gratification for me compared to one jacket?" The problem of dividing consumption to purely physical and emotional need is that most purchases are not purely one or another. Chocolate has calories which satisfies your physical needs, but it also satisfies your emotional ones. Denim jackets keep you warm which satisfies a physical need, but could be a fashion statement as well. &#x200B; Oppenheimer was definitely a blast btw, worth watching on the big screen.

Text: For the first time in my life, I started tracking my expenses. Sounds stupid I didn't do it until, now but I felt that I had all the money in the world, and could always "make more" or "work harder" in order to supplement the hole burning in my wallet. Turns out, when you're working you're exchanging your time for money (duh). I didn't dislike what I did, but I love the level of freedom I have now. Do I really need that new candle? Do I need to go on that cross-country trip to San Diego just because your Bay Area friends are going? Do I need to eat out and spend $45 min, or cook a delicious meal at home, especially if I enjoy the process? &#x200B; Noob Frugal community member, but excited in this journey

Where do you think your identity will have the most competitive advantage (country, industry, careers, etc.)? But at the same time, what is the lasting message you want to leave on the world? If you feel that you want to change the image of caucasians in Middle East it may be worth going the unconventional path. Best

Text: Did that in February. Purchased a lot of put options beginning of March, gains deceased as the market rebounded but still up by 3-4x I’m holding my puts until we hit SPY 195 which is in accordance to the recession bottom trend line from all the way back to the 1920s. From there I have around a dozen stocks I’d hold for the next few years until the market recovers. Probably will have 25% of my investments in bullish option spreads then, with the rest being stocks.

Text: Nice. Yeah I realize I should have done that. What I did was liquidate my active (stocks) and passive (index fund) in early February. I was thinking “even if there’s no recession, I don’t see the market going up anytime soon”. Only downside seemed that I’ll have to pay income tax on some of my short term investments. I mean, I wasn’t wrong, I didn’t lose any money. But oh boy if I had put some of that money into options early February, it would have been insane. Oh well, not complaining since I’m pretty well off for now.

Text: Yeah, it’s now about identifying sectors which have not seen that much of a downturn, but will in the future. Immediate industries (tourism, airlines, etc.) are already expected to fall. So maybe industries that will be indirectly impacted by the crisis are the ones to go after? Thinking about advertisement, insurance, cloud solutions (e.g. salesforce) Rural regions will be hit hard by the crisis, so regional banks may be a good idea too

Text: That’s the plan in around 2-3 weeks. Considering that China is still struggling to get its workforce back into the factories, it’ll take at least that long for China to be back in full motion. I’m a conservative guy, so when China’s manufacturing capabilities are back, I’d say that’s when I’ll start shifting my assets back to blue chip stocks. (Source: friend in China who owns a factory) Thanks for the advice though!

[COMMENT]
Text: Welcome to the 🐻side. Hope you don’t get laid off, but happy to provide my insight. I’m not a professional trader but have made 300% gains this past month. Here’s what I’m doing: Now that even Mckinsey is saying economic recovery will take until Q4, a lot of put options are starting to get expensive. It’s what people would call it “priced in”, since it’s no secret we’ll likely see a recession. With that being said I’ll still buy some puts. I’d buy put options on days when the market is making a rebound. Considering we went down like crazy today, I foresee a temporary bounce back tomorrow. I bought some apple, cvs, Walmart stocks today, and will sell them tomorrow hopefully around +4%. With that money, I intend to buy some call options. Which ones? Not entirely sure but thinking of following. SPY is a safe bet. If the economy goes down long term, so will SPY put options. Avoid airlines, as there’s been conversations of bail outs. If MGM or Wynn recovers a lot tomorrow (8%+) I’ll buy mid term (3 month) puts there. Don’t know enough about oil so won’t gamble there Think I missed the boat on VIX so not touching that too. Until when will I hold them? Probably will sell 1/2 in 2 weeks, the rest in 4 weeks. I know holding puts overnight or over weekends are a bad idea normally, but now that puts are so high in demand, I feel like holding them for a longer period is better than keeping on buying shorter puts. Even considering the value depreciation as it get closed to expiry date. (Not an expert but has worked for me so far). Why 2 weeks and 4 weeks? I want to play it safe. China has recovered from covid19 but people aren’t fully back to work yet. I have friends on the ground who own manufacturing companies and that’s their information. So earliest China is back full capacity is 2 weeks from now. Should be back to capacity in 4 weeks. Will the market keep on going down until end of Q3? Possibly. But I’ve made enough money and I don’t see a reason to take more risks. DM me if you want to know what I actually did, since the situation constantly changes.

Text: I’ve thought about this a lot too. Been asking my friends in China on what the situation is like. Seems like it’s true that the virus is not spreading as much (maybe not to the low levels that CCP dictates), but the economic impact still seems yet to come. The wife of the startup founder I invested into owns a huge material company, and she said that the people on the ground have yet to go back to work. She said they”don’t trust the government’s announcement that everything is OK”. In summary, I think I’ll liquidate 1/2 my puts in 2 weeks, and buy to long term stocks. The rest of the puts I’ll liquidate in around a month from now.

Text: It’ll be cool if this community took off. I’m Japanese, but grew up in Austria Serbia Slovenia, and now live in San Francisco. I moved to the Bay Area because I wanted to live in a place that had good career opportunity, diversity, weather, and work-life balance. I’ve always been search for an “ideal home”, and have traveled to London, Paris, Berlin, Zurich, Amsterdam, Rome, Madrid, Barcelona, Zagreb, Accra, Capetown, NYC, LA, Chicago, Toronto, Singapore, Taipei, Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen. Oh yeah and bunch of places in japan. The truth is, there’s no place that’s going to “call out to you”. Maybe there is, but it may take your entire life to find it, or you may never find it. Trying to be a “maximizer” will only get you so far in life. It’s important to sometimes be a “satisfier” and have some requirements, and stay wherever that meets what you’re looking for. (Book “paradox of choice”) The faster you commit to a place or community, the faster you find a “home” imo. I don’t regret traveling around though. A lot of it was business so I was able to do it as work, as well as meet a lot of locals through my company’s regional offices. It’s good to expand your horizon, but also important to find a time to reach a conclusion and commit.
